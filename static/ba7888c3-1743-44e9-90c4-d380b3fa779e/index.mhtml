<h3>Internal Transfer</h3>

<p>Internal transfer allows students to transfer, within Simon Fraser Unive=
rsity, from one faculty to another.</p>

<p>Simon Fraser University students applying for School of Computing Scienc=
e admission are selected on the basis of an admission Computing Related Gra=
de Point Average (CRGPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). The CRG=
PA is computed from all courses the student has taken from the following: (=
CMPT 120, 128 or 130), (CMPT 125, 129 or 135), CMPT 225, (CMPT 275 or 276),=
 CMPT 295, CMPT 300, CMPT 307, MACM 101, (CMPT 210 or MACM 201), MACM 316. =
Applicants must have completed at least one MACM course and at least two CM=
PT courses from this list before applying. At least two courses used in the=
 CRGPA calculation must have been taken at SFU.</p>

<p>No course may be included in the average if it is a duplicate of any pre=
vious course completed at Simon Fraser University or elsewhere.</p>

<p>The average for admission based on internal transfer is competitive and =
the school sets competitive averages each term.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CRGPA minimum average is 2.67 and the CGPA minimum average is 2.40 -=
 the competitive averages will never be below these minima.</p>
</div>



<h2>Continuation Requirements</h2>

<p>Students who do not maintain at least a 2.40 CGPA will be placed on prob=
ation within the School. Courses available to probationary students may be =
limited. Each term, these students must <a href=3D"http://www.sfu.ca/comput=
ing/prospective-students/undergraduate-students/admissions/advising.html">c=
onsult an advisor</a> prior to enrollment and must achieve either a term 2.=
40 term GPA or an improved CGPA. Students who fail to do so may be removed =
from the program.</p>
<p>Reinstatement from probationary standing occurs when the CGPA improves t=
o 2.40 or better and is maintained.</p>



<h2>Graduation Requirements</h2>

	An elementary introduction to computing science and computer programming, =
suitable for students with little or no programming background. Students wi=
ll learn fundamental concepts and terminology of computing science, acquire=
 elementary skills for programming in a high-level language, e.g. Python. T=
he students will be exposed to diverse fields within, and applications of c=
omputing science. Topics will include: pseudocode; data types and control s=
tructures; fundamental algorithms; recursion; reading and writing files; me=
asuring performance of algorithms; debugging tools; basic terminal navigati=
on using shell commands. Treatment is informal and programming is presented=
 as a problem-solving tool.  Prerequisite: BC Math 12 or equivalent is reco=
mmended.  Students with credit for <a href=3D"https://www.sfu.ca/students/c=

<h3>BEd Credential&nbsp;</h3>

<p>For a major in computing science in conjunction with a BEd program as of=
fered by the Faculty of Education, one additional CMPT course chosen from T=
able I or Table II must be completed, to total at least 30 upper division u=
nits in CMPT courses.</p>



<h3>BA Credential</h3>

<p>For a BA computing science degree within the Faculty of Applied Sciences=
, the following additional requirements must be met.</p>
<p>one additional CMPT upper division course chosen from Table I or Table I=
I must be completed bringing the total upper division units in CMPT courses=
 to a minimum of 30 units.</p>
<p>a concentration of 15 units in a Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences dis=
cipline (department) including at least six units of upper division credit.=
</p>



<h2>Areas of Concentration</h2>

<p>The primary upper division requirements are structured according to brea=
dth, depth and credential requirements as listed above.</p>
<p>As part of a major program, students may complete one or more areas of c=
oncentration from the six areas listed in Table I. To complete a concentrat=
ion, students complete the major requirements, including four courses in th=
e corresponding Area as listed in Table I, two of which must be at the 400 =
division. Courses used to meet the requirements of a concentration may also=
 be used to meet other program requirements.</p>

irements explicit and documenting them in a form amenable to analysis, reas=

 its construction. Students will learn methodical approaches to requirement=
